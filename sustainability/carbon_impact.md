By removing BLOB storage from Oracle Database:
- RMAN backups become smaller
- Data Guard redo generation drops
- Storage IO is reduced
- CPU and memory pressure is lowered

This results in:
- Faster backups
- Lower storage costs
- Reduced power consumption
- Lower CO₂ footprint in OCI and on-prem environments
