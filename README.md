## 💡 Why This Architecture Matters?
Modern "paperless" systems often rely on storing massive **BLOBs** (Binary Large Objects) directly in the database. While convenient, this traditional approach leads to:
- 🔋 **High CPU & I/O usage** (massive energy consumption).
- 💾 **Tablespace Bloat** and slow RMAN backup windows.
- ⚡ **Inefficient Data Guard replication** of static files.

**This solution provides a "Green IT" alternative.** By offloading documents to a secure, tokenized file server, we reduce the database workload, shrink the carbon footprint, and maintain enterprise-grade security.

---

## 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Zero BLOBs in DB:** Keeps the database lean and high-performing.
- **Secure Tokenization:** Only authorized APEX sessions can access files via temporary, one-time tokens.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Offloads file delivery from the DB to optimized document servers.
- **Green Savings:** Lower hardware overhead directly translates to lower power consumption in data centers.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Flow)
1. **Request:** A user in Oracle APEX clicks to view a document.
2. **Validation:** The Java REST layer calls the ORDS validation endpoint to check the user's current .
3. **Tokenization:** Upon successful validation, a unique secure path/token is provided.
4. **HTTPS Delivery:** The file is streamed directly from the server via HTTPS, bypassing the database processing engine completely.
